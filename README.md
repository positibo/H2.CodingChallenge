# H2.CodingChallenge
Schedule Coding Challenge

1.) You need to calculate calendar schedules for project plans.

2.) Each project plan consists of tasks, and every task has a defined duration.

3.) A task may depend on zero or more other tasks. If a task has dependencies, it can only start once all dependent tasks are completed.

4.) Based on a given set of tasks (with durations and dependencies), your solution should generate a schedule by assigning Start and End Dates for every task.

5.) A console app implementation is acceptable.

6.) Your solution should be pushed to GitHub.

7.) Please include Unit Tests in your submission.

H2.Exam 
A console application that executes the project plan tasks.

H2.Scheduler
A class library that calculate the calendar schedules for project plans.

H2.UnitTests
A unit tests to check the implementation if correct.
